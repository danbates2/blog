&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiple-emoncms-accounts&quot;&gt;1. Multiple emoncms accounts:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor multiple Emoncms accounts, very useful for installers, power users etc.
It’s also possible for these accounts to be on different Emoncms servers e.g. emoncms.org, emonPi, emonBase, yourawesomeserver.com etc. Additional account are easily added to the app using the built in QR code scanner and scanning the QR code on the ‘Account’ section of Emoncms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/androidv2-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;androidv2-multiple&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiple-myelectric-graphs-per-account&quot;&gt;2. Multiple MyElectric graphs per account:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful to monitor more than one power feed: e.g. House consumption, Heat Pump consumption, Solar PV production, EV charging etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/app1.png&quot; alt=&quot;app1&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/app2.png&quot; alt=&quot;app2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiple-currency-rates-for-each-myelectric-graph&quot;&gt;3. Multiple currency rates for each MyElectric graph:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g day rate / night rate, Economy7, solar PV FIT, hydro etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/app-cost.png&quot; alt=&quot;app-cost&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;language-translations&quot;&gt;4. Language Translations:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French, German, Dutch, Italien and Spanish all rank among the top 5 for the Emoncms app in terms of active installs. We have now added the full native language support they deserve. Thanks a lot to the community for helping to proof and beta test. See bottom of this post for how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonpi_wifi.png&quot; alt=&quot;emonpi wifi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just made significant progress in streamlining the setup process by enabling the emonPi / emonBase to broadcast a WiFi access-point (AP) on first boot then scan for local WiFi networks and allow the user to connect. The emonPi will then turn off it’s AP and connect to the local network. There is also an option to connect via Ethernet or stand-alone WiFi AP mode when no local network is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonpi-network-wizard1.png&quot; alt=&quot;emonpi-network-wizard1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has now been made possible using the Raspberry Pi 3 which supports WiFi access-point AP mode, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/tree/master/wifiAP&quot;&gt;some bash scrips&lt;/a&gt; and a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/tree/master/emoncms-setup&quot;&gt;emoncms-setup module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Network Setup Wizard will be included on all new purchased in July 2017 onwards. Existing emonPi’s with a Raspberry Pi 3 can be updated by running Admin &amp;gt; emonPi update in Emoncms. The emonPi will only broadcast a WiFi AP if Ethernet is not connected and no WiFi setup is currently present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trystan is also working on making the input-processing setup for new devices easier by adding device template support to the Emoncms Device module. More on this the come…&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/development-devices-inputs-and-feeds-in-emoncms/4281&quot;&gt;see development forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

For example being able to control my home central heating system remotely enables me to only turn on the heating when it’s required and not have it running on a set schedule when the house is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;2016/08/ecohomelab-control/&quot;&gt; previously mentioned in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the emonPi (&lt;a href=&quot;github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/wiki/emonSD-pre-built-SD-card-Download-&amp;amp;-Change-Log&quot;&gt;running emonSD pre-built SD card&lt;/a&gt;) can function as a powerful home automation hub. Utilising the emonPi as a home automation hub is a good fit for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already running 24/7 for energy monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s optimised for robust long term operation: the root Raspberry Pi file-system is read-only to increase SD card lifespan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already connected to your local network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s running Debian Raspbian Jessie therefore installing extra packages is easy and lots of support is available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 has plenty of space capacity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra radios / accessories can be connected via USB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already running an MQTT server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emonSD pre-built SD card comes pre loaded with the following &lt;a href=&quot;guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations&quot;&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt; nodeRED, OpenHAB and LightWaveRF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this post I want to share with you how I use the emonPi in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video demo using Google Home to control my central heating and devices via MQTT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_v4GXVp0OI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how this is achieved using an emonPi and open-source software…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many many options when it comes to home automation and control. Where possible I prefer open-source solutions which do not depend on any third-party services. All the software services for my home system as I describe in this post runs locally on my emonPi and apart from Google Home voice integration does not require an internet connection to function. A self-hosted open-source solution has the added benefit of increased privacy and security which you are in fully in control of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mqtt&quot;&gt;MQTT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MQTT lightweight communication protocol is used as the ‘glue’ communication layer between all the following services. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/mqtt/&quot;&gt;technical/MQTT section of the User Guide&lt;/a&gt; for more info about how MQTT works on the emonPi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy-monitoring&quot;&gt;Energy Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emoncms…obviously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been loving using the V2 Emoncms Android app (currently in beta) which supports multiple pages (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emoncms-android-app-v2-0-1-open-beta-testing/3373&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video demo Emoncms Android app V2 beta:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaTi-l9tVQM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also recently enjoyed using the redesigned Emoncms Apps module which have just bee released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://emoncms.org&quot;&gt;Emoncms.org&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now possible to have more than one MyElectric or MySolarPV ‘app’ per Emoncms account and Economy 7 split time of use tariffs are now spported (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/new-version-of-the-emoncms-apps-module/3900/3&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/myelectric-e7.png&quot; alt=&quot;myelectric-e7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;control&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;central-heating&quot;&gt;Central Heating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To control my gas central heating boiler I use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/mqtt-relay/&quot;&gt;MQTT WiFi relay&lt;/a&gt; which also has a built in thermostat and scheduler, although I don’t use these features, I just control directly via MQTT. The WiFi Relay has been very reliable, it’s been used daily for the past two years in my home and never once required a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mqtt-relay-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;mqtt-relay-overview.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plug-sockets-lights&quot;&gt;Plug sockets (lights)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use LightWave RF plugs to which I have lights and other entertainment devices connected e.g. stereo and chromecast. Being able to switch a whole plug bank on/off has the advantage of being able to turn devices fully off when not in use to minimise any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power&quot;&gt;vampire drain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emonPi can control LightWave RF devices directly via MQTT if an RF OOk modules is fitted. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/lightwaverf&quot;&gt;LightWave RF emonPi User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lightwave-rf-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;lightwave-rf-diagram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LightWave RF devices are not perfect, the OOK RF protocol is simplistic, unsecure, occasionally unreliable and state feedback is not available. I am considering swithcing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itead.cc/smart-socket.html&quot;&gt;ESp8266 based Sonoff plug&lt;/a&gt; with third party &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota&quot;&gt;MQTT firmware&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonesp&quot;&gt;EmonESP&lt;/a&gt; firmware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interface&quot;&gt;Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I have been using OpenHAB as the control interface. &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/openhab&quot;&gt;OpenHAB is pre-loaded onto the emonPi emonSD pre-built image&lt;/a&gt;. I am yet to upgrade to OpenHAB V2.0, it looks very nice. However, V1.8 has been very reliable and fits my needs. I use the OpenHAB Android app to access the interface quickly from my phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-hab-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;open-hab-home.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-hab-all.png&quot; alt=&quot;open-hab-all.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenHAB also &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5542604d45bf334314000098?section=watchapps&quot;&gt;integrates with my Pebble smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; which makes it super easy to turn on/off the heating while out and about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openhab-pebble.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openhab-pebble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back (early 2016) I dabbled with &lt;a href=&quot;http://home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2016/04/Home-Assistant/&quot;&gt;see blog post&lt;/a&gt;). I was quite impressed, I have been following the project and it looks like it’s matured to be an excellent home automation platform. Quit possibly a rival to OpenHAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for an interface is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard&quot;&gt;NodeRED Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; which is now officially part of the NodeRED project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beauty of MQTT is that it’s platform agnostic, it’s possible to have many different interfaces controlling the same control nodes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;voice-interface&quot;&gt;Voice interface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently acquired a Google Home voice activated speaker, with a little help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge&quot;&gt;ha-bridge&lt;/a&gt; to emulate a Philips Hue bridge it’s quite easy to get Google Home to control local devices via MQTT. The same setup will also work with Amazon Echo. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi-ha-bridge&quot;&gt;ha-bridge setup guide for emonPi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See video demo at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Device config using ha-bridge webpage GUI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/google-home-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-home-app.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integration--automation&quot;&gt;Integration &amp;amp; Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/nodered&quot;&gt;NodeRED which is pre-loaded on emonPi / emonSD&lt;/a&gt; to integrate with other services such a getting the latest outdoor temperature from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/&quot;&gt;Weather Underground&lt;/a&gt;, send push notifications (heating on / off temperature alert) to my phone using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt;. Both these services have pre-made nodeRED flows making integration very easy. NodeRED is pre-installed and configured on emonPi / emonSD. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/oem_node-red/blob/master/flows_emonpi.json&quot;&gt;example flow included on emonPi&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates reading emonTH data from MQTT and external temperature data from Weather Underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a nodeRED flow that handles turning off the heating when the temperature in the livingroom (as measured by emonTH) reaches a set point. I could have used the thermostat controller on the WiFi relay to do this, however it would be difficult in my house to run the wired temperature sensor from the Wifi relay to the living room, therefore I use a wireless emonTH temperature instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;security-and-remote-access&quot;&gt;Security and remote access&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote control (from outside the local network) can be achieved using a dynamic DNS service such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duckdns.org/&quot;&gt;DuckDNS&lt;/a&gt; or secure VPN to give access to services from the outside. E.g I open port 8080 to give access to OpenHAB running on my emonPi from the internet. OpenHAB has authentication turned on and HTTPS can be used to create a secure connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, and possibly a better solution could be to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myopenhab.org/&quot;&gt;MyOpenhab.org&lt;/a&gt; service to allow remote control without having to open up a port externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Assistant has got an example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/tor/&quot;&gt;using Tor Onion Services to access Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; running locally.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Glyn Hudson</name></author><summary>I believe automation can play an useful role in helping to reduce energy consumption. For example being able to control my home central heating system remotely enables me to only turn on the heating when it’s required and not have it running on a set schedule when the house is empty.

As  previously mentioned in a blog post, the emonPi (running emonSD pre-built SD card) can function as a powerful home automation hub. Utilising the emonPi as a home automation hub is a good fit for a number of reasons:


  It’s already running 24/7 for energy monitoring
  It’s optimised for robust long term operation: the root Raspberry Pi file-system is read-only to increase SD card lifespan
  It’s already connected to your local network
  It’s running Debian Raspbian Jessie therefore installing extra packages is easy and lots of support is available
  Raspberry Pi 3 has plenty of space capacity
  Extra radios / accessories can be connected via USB
  It’s already running an MQTT server
  emonSD pre-built SD card comes pre loaded with the following integrations nodeRED, OpenHAB and LightWaveRF



  In this post I want to share with you how I use the emonPi in my own home.


Here is a video demo using Google Home to control my central heating and devices via MQTT:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An EVSE charging station, is a device an electric car (EV) is plugged into to charge. It communicates to the car to agree on a charging rate that is the fastest and safest rate both the car and the power supply can support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/leaf-openevse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse leaf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build9&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this review is my account of using the OpenEVSE in the UK (240V single-phase AC), see OpenEVSE website for official build guides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that make the OpenEVSE charge controller interesting to us are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/OpenEVSE+WiFi+%28Beta%29/14&quot;&gt;WiFi connectivity and remote control (via ESP8266)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variable rate of charge: e.g. charge current can be varied to match available power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrated energy monitoring via custom hosted Emoncms &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.openevse.com/emoncms&quot;&gt;data.openevse.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully open-source :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recently swapped my ageing diesel car for an all-electric Nissan LEAF (it’s fantastic), so it felt like the perfect time to build and test an OpenEVSE charge controller unit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissan LEAF charging from solar PV on a frosty morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nissan-leaf-solar-pv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nissan-leaf-solar-pv&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is possible to charge an EV via a standard electrical outlet, it is not recommended for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charging is very slow since the current is limited by the electrical outlet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drawing a significant current (approx 10/12A) for an extended period (up to 10hrs for a 24KWh Nissan LEAF and 30hrs for a 90KWh Tesla Model S!) puts stress on the domestic wiring resulting in heating of the wire &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakev.com/threads/house-fire-using-120v-trickle-charger.1708/&quot;&gt;or worse&lt;/a&gt; if the wiring is in a poor state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Charging via a properly installed EVSE is the fastest and safest way to charge an EV at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE units have been designed to exceed the safety requirements for EV Charging Stations from SAE J1772, NEC and UL. Before supplying power to the car (and continuously while charging) the EVSE unit conducts a number of checks, no power is supplied until all the checks have passed. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://openev.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000113537-openevse-safety-features&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE Safety Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;purchase&quot;&gt;Purchase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: we are in communication with OpenEVSE to put together a UK/Europe specific OpeneEVSE package to resell via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.openenergymonitor.com&quot;&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor Online Shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE units can be purchased (kit or fully assembled) from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE online store&lt;/a&gt;, the units are shipped from California USA. I went for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/openevse-50a-charge-station-combo-with-enclosure&quot;&gt;P50D Level 2 Deluxe OpenEVSE kit&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/openevse-wifi-kit&quot;&gt;WiFi connection kit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/j1772-cable-40a-ultra-flexible-us-only&quot;&gt;J1772 Cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenEVSE 50A L2 unit will charge any J1772 compliant car at up to 40A continous from a single phase 208-240V AC supply. However, you can dial back the current by setting the ‘max charge current’ to match your supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: Chris Howell from OpenEVSE made the unit available free of charge for me to evaluate and improve the Emoncms / OpenEnergyMonitor integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assembly&quot;&gt;Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assembly of an EVSE requires wiring Alternating Current (AC) components that will be exposed to voltages from 100 to 250v. If you do not have the experience and knowledge required to safely work with AC voltages please consult with an experienced electrician for assistance and inspection of your work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembly of the unit was straight forward following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/OpenEVSE+50A+Charging+Station/8&quot;&gt;openEVSE build guide&lt;/a&gt;. No soldering was required, only basic tools e.g. screwdriver, wire strippers etc. Assembly probably took me a couple of hours. I took my time to do a high-quality job of assembling, this is particularly important given the high currents involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware components are all top quality, I was impressed by the attention to detail such as rubber seals around the LCD to waterproof the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware inside the unit is split into two main components which are physically separated: a high voltage and high current relay and a low voltage control electronics which is the microcontroller (ATmega328p) ‘brains’ of the unit. My unit contained an OpenEVSE Plus V4 control unit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openevse.com/files/OpenEVSE_Plus_v4.pdf&quot;&gt;see Datasheet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rear PCB showing ATmega328p on the OpenEVSE Plus V4 controller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build progress: charge controller, ground busbar, relay, LCD and mode button fixed into enclosure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished build: WiFi ESP8266 module is visible on the top left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation should be undertaken by a qualified electrician. The unit should be wired in using suitably rated cable ideally with a dedicated RCD circuit breaker. The max charge current of the unit should be set to match the supply circuit wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;operation&quot;&gt;Operation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On first powerup some basic settings are set via the LCD menu using a combination of short/long presses of the front button. The menu system is impressively responsive considering it’s running from an ATmega328! The basic settings include max charge rate (set to match wiring), charging service level and date-time. Settings are saved to EEPROM and date-time is kept up-to-date via a RTC battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic operation is very straightforward: just plug the car in and charging begins! Charging can be stopped/resumed by pressing the button on the front of the unit. Charging state is indicated by the backlight colour of the LCD and basic info such as current charging current and total kWh is displayed on the LCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of the unit charging my Nissan LEAF @ 26A. At this charge rate my 6.6Kw charge (24Kwh battery) Nissan LEAF will charge from flat in about 4hrs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse-front&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo of the basic features of the unit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIvmYP57eOo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-datalogging&quot;&gt;Remote Datalogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wifi kit (ESP8266) enables data logging from the OpenEVSE unit to a custom Emoncms server &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.openevse.com&quot;&gt;data.openevse.com&lt;/a&gt; via a local Wifi connection. The Wifi kit also allows remote control (see RAPI commands below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build-emoncms.png&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-control-via-rapi-commands&quot;&gt;Remote Control (via RAPI commands)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenEVSE unit can be controlled and monitored remotely via serial RAPI (Remote API) commands. These commands can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/Serial+Communications+with+OpenEVSE/13&quot;&gt;issued directly via serial&lt;/a&gt; or the OpenEVSE WiFi kit (ESP8266) can be added to allow RAPI commands to be issued remotely via an HTTP web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;variable-charge-rate&quot;&gt;Variable Charge Rate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE charge controller can vary the charge rate, or more specifically the OpenEVSE can ‘request’ a particular charge rate from the car. It is actually the cars charging control electronics that varies the charge rate. OpenEVSE requests a particular charge rate by varying the pilot signal square wave duty cycle &lt;a href=&quot;https://openev.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000052070-theory-of-operation&quot;&gt;see OpenEVSE technical theory of opperation&lt;/a&gt;. Charge rate can be varied from 6A (SAE/IEC standard min charge current) up to max charge rate (28A for my Nissan LEAF) in 1A increments. The car responds almost instantly to a charge rate adjustment request from the OpenEVSE controller. Charging can also be paused and resumed remotely if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$SC13&lt;/code&gt; will set the current charge current to 13A. The screen shot on the right below illustrates issuing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$SC 13&lt;/code&gt; RAPI command into the OpenEVSE local web page interface (served from ESP8266). The screenshot on the left shows the effect of reduction in charge rate as monitored by emonPi displayed using Emoncms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build6.png&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapi commands can also be issued directly via a single HTTP request. Eg. the same rapi command to set charging rate to 13A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24SC+13&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24SC+13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sleep (pause a charge) issue RAPI command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$FS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FS&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable (start a charge) issue RAPI command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$FE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FE&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assuming &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.108&lt;/code&gt; is the local IP address of the OpenEVSE ESP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiramiseb/python-openevse&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE RAPI command python library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAPI commands can be used to control and check the status of all OpenEVSE functions. A full list of RAPI commands can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lincomatic/open_evse/blob/stable/rapi_proc.h&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE plus source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-developments&quot;&gt;Future developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add MQTT support to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chris1howell/OpenEVSE_RAPI_WiFi_ESP8266&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE WiFi ESP8266 firmware&lt;/a&gt;, this will allow RAPI commands to be issued via MQTT over an authenticated local MQTT server e.g. emonPi / RaspberryPi or remote MQTT server e.g. Hive MQTT / Cloud MQTT. Using MQTT will make it easier and more secure to control the OpenEVSE. MQTT allow easy integration with all home automation and control platforms e.g nodeRED / OpenHAB / Emoncms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I have recently added RAPI commands over MQTT support to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chris1howell/OpenEVSE_RAPI_WiFi_ESP8266/tree/Devolopment&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE ESP8266 code currently in the dev branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  An EVSE charging station, is a device an electric car (EV) is plugged into to charge. It communicates to the car to agree on a charging rate that is the fastest and safest rate both the car and the power supply can support.


Update March 17: OpenEnergyMonitor and proud to announce that we are now the UK / Europe reseller for OpenEVSE charging stations, see OpenEnergyMonitor Online Shop.







Note: this review is my account of using the OpenEVSE in the UK (240V single-phase AC), see OpenEVSE website for official build guides

Features

The features that make the OpenEVSE charge controller interesting to us are:


  WiFi connectivity and remote control (via ESP8266)
  Variable rate of charge: e.g. charge current can be varied to match available power
  Integrated energy monitoring via custom hosted Emoncms data.openevse.com
  Fully open-source :-)


I recently swapped my ageing diesel car for an all-electric Nissan LEAF (it’s fantastic), so it felt like the perfect time to build and test an OpenEVSE charge controller unit!
