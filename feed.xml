For example being able to control my home central heating system remotely enables me to only turn on the heating when it’s required and not have it running on a set schedule when the house is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;2016/08/ecohomelab-control/&quot;&gt; previously mentioned in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the emonPi (&lt;a href=&quot;github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi/wiki/emonSD-pre-built-SD-card-Download-&amp;amp;-Change-Log&quot;&gt;running emonSD pre-built SD card&lt;/a&gt;) can function as a powerful home automation hub. Utilising the emonPi as a home automation hub is a good fit for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already running 24/7 for energy monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s optimised for robust long term operation: the root Raspberry Pi file-system is read-only to increase SD card lifespan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already connected to your local network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s running Debian Raspbian Jessie therefore installing extra packages is easy and lots of support is available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 has plenty of space capacity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra radios / accessories can be connected via USB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s already running an MQTT server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emonSD pre-built SD card comes pre loaded with the following &lt;a href=&quot;guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations&quot;&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt; nodeRED, OpenHAB and LightWaveRF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this post I want to share with you how I use the emonPi in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video demo using Google Home to control my central heating and devices via MQTT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_v4GXVp0OI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how this is achieved using an emonPi and open-source software…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many many options when it comes to home automation and control. Where possible I prefer open-source solutions which do not depend on any third-party services. All the software services for my home system as I describe in this post runs locally on my emonPi and apart from Google Home voice integration does not require an internet connection to function. A self-hosted open-source solution has the added benefit of increased privacy and security which you are in fully in control of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mqtt&quot;&gt;MQTT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MQTT lightweight communication protocol is used as the ‘glue’ communication layer between all the following services. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/mqtt/&quot;&gt;technical/MQTT section of the User Guide&lt;/a&gt; for more info about how MQTT works on the emonPi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy-monitoring&quot;&gt;Energy Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emoncms…obviously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been loving using the V2 Emoncms Android app (currently in beta) which supports multiple pages (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emoncms-android-app-v2-0-1-open-beta-testing/3373&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video demo Emoncms Android app V2 beta:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also recently enjoyed using the redesigned Emoncms Apps module which have just bee released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://emoncms.org&quot;&gt;Emoncms.org&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now possible to have more than one MyElectric or MySolarPV ‘app’ per Emoncms account and Economy 7 split time of use tariffs are now spported (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/new-version-of-the-emoncms-apps-module/3900/3&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/myelectric-e7.png&quot; alt=&quot;myelectric-e7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;control&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;central-heating&quot;&gt;Central Heating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To control my gas central heating boiler I use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/mqtt-relay/&quot;&gt;MQTT WiFi relay&lt;/a&gt; which also has a built in thermostat and scheduler, although I don’t use these features, I just control directly via MQTT. The WiFi Relay has been very reliable, it’s been used daily for the past two years in my home and never once required a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mqtt-relay-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;mqtt-relay-overview.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plug-sockets-lights&quot;&gt;Plug sockets (lights)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use LightWave RF plugs to which I have lights and other entertainment devices connected e.g. stereo and chromecast. Being able to switch a whole plug bank on/off has the advantage of being able to turn devices fully off when not in use to minimise any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power&quot;&gt;vampire drain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emonPi can control LightWave RF devices directly via MQTT if an RF OOk modules is fitted. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/lightwaverf&quot;&gt;LightWave RF emonPi User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lightwave-rf-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;lightwave-rf-diagram.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LightWave RF devices are not perfect, the OOK RF protocol is simplistic, unsecure, occasionally unreliable and state feedback is not available. I am considering swithcing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itead.cc/smart-socket.html&quot;&gt;ESp8266 based Sonoff plug&lt;/a&gt; with third party &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota&quot;&gt;MQTT firmware&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonesp&quot;&gt;EmonESP&lt;/a&gt; firmware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interface&quot;&gt;Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I have been using OpenHAB as the control interface. &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/openhab&quot;&gt;OpenHAB is pre-loaded onto the emonPi emonSD pre-built image&lt;/a&gt;. I am yet to upgrade to OpenHAB V2.0, it looks very nice. However, V1.8 has been very reliable and fits my needs. I use the OpenHAB Android app to access the interface quickly from my phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-hab-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;open-hab-home.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/open-hab-all.png&quot; alt=&quot;open-hab-all.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenHAB also &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5542604d45bf334314000098?section=watchapps&quot;&gt;integrates with my Pebble smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; which makes it super easy to turn on/off the heating while out and about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openhab-pebble.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openhab-pebble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back (early 2016) I dabbled with &lt;a href=&quot;http://home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2016/04/Home-Assistant/&quot;&gt;see blog post&lt;/a&gt;). I was quite impressed, I have been following the project and it looks like it’s matured to be an excellent home automation platform. Quit possibly a rival to OpenHAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for an interface is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard&quot;&gt;NodeRED Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; which is now officially part of the NodeRED project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beauty of MQTT is that it’s platform agnostic, it’s possible to have many different interfaces controlling the same control nodes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;voice-interface&quot;&gt;Voice interface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently acquired a Google Home voice activated speaker, with a little help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge&quot;&gt;ha-bridge&lt;/a&gt; to emulate a Philips Hue bridge it’s quite easy to get Google Home to control local devices via MQTT. The same setup will also work with Amazon Echo. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonpi-ha-bridge&quot;&gt;ha-bridge setup guide for emonPi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See video demo at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Device config using ha-bridge webpage GUI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ha-bridge-device-config.png&quot; alt=&quot;ha-bridge-device-config.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Home app setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/google-home-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-home-app.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integration--automation&quot;&gt;Integration &amp;amp; Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/nodered&quot;&gt;NodeRED which is pre-loaded on emonPi / emonSD&lt;/a&gt; to integrate with other services such a getting the latest outdoor temperature from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/&quot;&gt;Weather Underground&lt;/a&gt;, send push notifications (heating on / off temperature alert) to my phone using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt;. Both these services have pre-made nodeRED flows making integration very easy. NodeRED is pre-installed and configured on emonPi / emonSD. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/oem_node-red/blob/master/flows_emonpi.json&quot;&gt;example flow included on emonPi&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates reading emonTH data from MQTT and external temperature data from Weather Underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a nodeRED flow that handles turning off the heating when the temperature in the livingroom (as measured by emonTH) reaches a set point. I could have used the thermostat controller on the WiFi relay to do this, however it would be difficult in my house to run the wired temperature sensor from the Wifi relay to the living room, therefore I use a wireless emonTH temperature instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;security-and-remote-access&quot;&gt;Security and remote access&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote control (from outside the local network) can be achieved using a dynamic DNS service such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duckdns.org/&quot;&gt;DuckDNS&lt;/a&gt; or secure VPN to give access to services from the outside. E.g I open port 8080 to give access to OpenHAB running on my emonPi from the internet. OpenHAB has authentication turned on and HTTPS can be used to create a secure connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, and possibly a better solution could be to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myopenhab.org/&quot;&gt;MyOpenhab.org&lt;/a&gt; service to allow remote control without having to open up a port externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Assistant has got an example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/tor/&quot;&gt;using Tor Onion Services to access Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; running locally.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Glyn Hudson</name></author><summary>I believe automation can play an useful role in helping to reduce energy consumption. For example being able to control my home central heating system remotely enables me to only turn on the heating when it’s required and not have it running on a set schedule when the house is empty.

We have also launched a new website called &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.openenergymonitor.org&quot;&gt;Learn&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks&quot;&gt;Building Blocks section&lt;/a&gt; of the old site. All URL’s directed to building blocks should re-direct automatically to the relevant Learn page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/home-page-devices.png&quot; alt=&quot;devices&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aim behind the redesign was to bring our interest and driving motivation of working towards sustainable energy and zero carbon more to the fore of the project. Energy Monitoring is a tool to help us understand our use of energy, and our motivation for starting the project was to understand our use of energy at home in relation to the wider context of what needs to be done if we are to get off fossil fuels and build a zero carbon energy system - We hope this update better reflects this interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website redesign completes the shift away from using Drupal 6 cms that was started with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org&quot;&gt;User Guide website&lt;/a&gt; launched April 2016 and a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://Community.openenergymonitor.org&quot;&gt;Community Form&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://discourse.org&quot;&gt;Discource&lt;/a&gt; launched May 2016. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://openenergymonitor.org/emon/forum&quot;&gt;old forums&lt;/a&gt; are still accessible as a read-only archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the new front page we have also launched a new website called Learn which includes what used to be called Building Blocks, resources for learning about AC Power Theory, CT Sensors, Measurement circuit design through to Timeseries data storage design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn also includes a large updated section on Sustainable Energy which brings together and expands on our work on understanding the wider context, including a web-based 10 year hourly 100% renewable energy model based on ZeroCarbonBritain and resources on building energy modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this review is my account of using the OpenEVSE in the UK (240V single-phase AC), see OpenEVSE website for official build guides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that make the OpenEVSE charge controller interesting to us are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/OpenEVSE+WiFi+%28Beta%29/14&quot;&gt;WiFi connectivity and remote control (via ESP8266)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variable rate of charge: e.g. charge current can be varied to match available power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrated energy monitoring via custom hosted Emoncms &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.openevse.com/emoncms&quot;&gt;data.openevse.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully open-source :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recently swapped my ageing diesel car for an all-electric Nissan LEAF (it’s fantastic), so it felt like the perfect time to build and test an OpenEVSE charge controller unit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nissan LEAF charging from solar PV on a frosty morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nissan-leaf-solar-pv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nissan-leaf-solar-pv&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9D48V1D1G4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is possible to charge an EV via a standard electrical outlet, it is not recommended for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charging is very slow since the current is limited by the electrical outlet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drawing a significant current (approx 10/12A) for an extended period (up to 10hrs for a 24KWh Nissan LEAF and 30hrs for a 90KWh Tesla Model S!) puts stress on the domestic wiring resulting in heating of the wire &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakev.com/threads/house-fire-using-120v-trickle-charger.1708/&quot;&gt;or worse&lt;/a&gt; if the wiring is in a poor state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Charging via a properly installed EVSE is the fastest and safest way to charge an EV at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE units have been designed to exceed the safety requirements for EV Charging Stations from SAE J1772, NEC and UL. Before supplying power to the car (and continuously while charging) the EVSE unit conducts a number of checks, no power is supplied until all the checks have passed. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://openev.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000113537-openevse-safety-features&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE Safety Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;purchase&quot;&gt;Purchase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: we are in communication with OpenEVSE to put together a UK/Europe specific OpeneEVSE package to resell via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.openenergymonitor.com&quot;&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor Online Shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE units can be purchased (kit or fully assembled) from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE online store&lt;/a&gt;, the units are shipped from California USA. I went for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/openevse-50a-charge-station-combo-with-enclosure&quot;&gt;P50D Level 2 Deluxe OpenEVSE kit&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/openevse-wifi-kit&quot;&gt;WiFi connection kit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.openevse.com/collections/frontpage/products/j1772-cable-40a-ultra-flexible-us-only&quot;&gt;J1772 Cable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenEVSE 50A L2 unit will charge any J1772 compliant car at up to 40A continous from a single phase 208-240V AC supply. However, you can dial back the current by setting the ‘max charge current’ to match your supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: Chris Howell from OpenEVSE made the unit available free of charge for me to evaluate and improve the Emoncms / OpenEnergyMonitor integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assembly&quot;&gt;Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assembly of an EVSE requires wiring Alternating Current (AC) components that will be exposed to voltages from 100 to 250v. If you do not have the experience and knowledge required to safely work with AC voltages please consult with an experienced electrician for assistance and inspection of your work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembly of the unit was straight forward following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/OpenEVSE+50A+Charging+Station/8&quot;&gt;openEVSE build guide&lt;/a&gt;. No soldering was required, only basic tools e.g. screwdriver, wire strippers etc. Assembly probably took me a couple of hours. I took my time to do a high-quality job of assembling, this is particularly important given the high currents involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware components are all top quality, I was impressed by the attention to detail such as rubber seals around the LCD to waterproof the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware inside the unit is split into two main components which are physically separated: a high voltage and high current relay and a low voltage control electronics which is the microcontroller (ATmega328p) ‘brains’ of the unit. My unit contained an OpenEVSE Plus V4 control unit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openevse.com/files/OpenEVSE_Plus_v4.pdf&quot;&gt;see Datasheet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rear PCB showing ATmega328p on the OpenEVSE Plus V4 controller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build progress: charge controller, ground busbar, relay, LCD and mode button fixed into enclosure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished build: WiFi ESP8266 module is visible on the top left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation should be undertaken by a qualified electrician. The unit should be wired in using suitably rated cable ideally with a dedicated RCD circuit breaker. The max charge current of the unit should be set to match the supply circuit wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;operation&quot;&gt;Operation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On first powerup some basic settings are set via the LCD menu using a combination of short/long presses of the front button. The menu system is impressively responsive considering it’s running from an ATmega328! The basic settings include max charge rate (set to match wiring), charging service level and date-time. Settings are saved to EEPROM and date-time is kept up-to-date via a RTC battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic operation is very straightforward: just plug the car in and charging begins! Charging can be stopped/resumed by pressing the button on the front of the unit. Charging state is indicated by the backlight colour of the LCD and basic info such as current charging current and total kWh is displayed on the LCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of the unit charging my Nissan LEAF @ 26A. At this charge rate my 6.6Kw charge (24Kwh battery) Nissan LEAF will charge from flat in about 4hrs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;openevse-front&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a nice demo of the basic features of the unit. Credit: YouTube user civicturbo2009:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BFseWN7JhNM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-datalogging&quot;&gt;Remote Datalogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wifi kit (ESP8266) enables data logging from the OpenEVSE unit to a custom Emoncms server &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.openevse.com&quot;&gt;data.openevse.com&lt;/a&gt; via a local Wifi connection. The Wifi kit also allows remote control (see RAPI commands below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build-emoncms.png&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-control-via-rapi-commands&quot;&gt;Remote Control (via RAPI commands)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenEVSE unit can be controlled and monitored remotely via serial RAPI (Remote API) commands. These commands can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://openevse.dozuki.com/Guide/Serial+Communications+with+OpenEVSE/13&quot;&gt;issued directly via serial&lt;/a&gt; or the OpenEVSE WiFi kit (ESP8266) can be added to allow RAPI commands to be issued remotely via an HTTP web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;variable-charge-rate&quot;&gt;Variable Charge Rate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenEVSE charge controller can vary the charge rate, or more specifically the OpenEVSE can ‘request’ a particular charge rate from the car. It is actually the cars charging control electronics that varies the charge rate. OpenEVSE requests a particular charge rate by varying the pilot signal square wave duty cycle &lt;a href=&quot;https://openev.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000052070-theory-of-operation&quot;&gt;see OpenEVSE technical theory of opperation&lt;/a&gt;. Charge rate can be varied from 6A (SAE/IEC standard min charge current) up to max charge rate (28A for my Nissan LEAF) in 1A increments. The car responds almost instantly to a charge rate adjustment request from the OpenEVSE controller. Charging can also be paused and resumed remotely if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$SC13&lt;/code&gt; will set the current charge current to 13A. The screen shot on the right below illustrates issuing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$SC 13&lt;/code&gt; RAPI command into the OpenEVSE local web page interface (served from ESP8266). The screenshot on the left shows the effect of reduction in charge rate as monitored by emonPi displayed using Emoncms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openevse-build6.png&quot; alt=&quot;openevse build6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapi commands can also be issued directly via a single HTTP request. Eg. the same rapi command to set charging rate to 13A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24SC+13&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24SC+13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sleep (pause a charge) issue RAPI command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$FS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FS&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable (start a charge) issue RAPI command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$FE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FE&quot;&gt;http://192.168.0.108/r?rapi=%24FE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assuming &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.108&lt;/code&gt; is the local IP address of the OpenEVSE ESP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiramiseb/python-openevse&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE RAPI command python library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAPI commands can be used to control and check the status of all OpenEVSE functions. A full list of RAPI commands can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lincomatic/open_evse/blob/stable/rapi_proc.h&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE plus source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-developments&quot;&gt;Future developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add MQTT support to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chris1howell/OpenEVSE_RAPI_WiFi_ESP8266&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE WiFi ESP8266 firmware&lt;/a&gt;, this will allow RAPI commands to be issued via MQTT over an authenticated local MQTT server e.g. emonPi / RaspberryPi or remote MQTT server e.g. Hive MQTT / Cloud MQTT. Using MQTT will make it easier and more secure to control the OpenEVSE. MQTT allow easy integration with all home automation and control platforms e.g nodeRED / OpenHAB / Emoncms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I have recently added RAPI commands over MQTT support to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chris1howell/OpenEVSE_RAPI_WiFi_ESP8266/tree/Devolopment&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE ESP8266 code currently in the dev branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emonTH V2 features a Silicon Labs &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents%2FTechnicalDocs%2FSi7021-A20.pdf&quot;&gt;Si7021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; temperature and humidity sensor instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor-am2302/&quot;&gt;DHT22 sensor&lt;/a&gt;. The Si7021 is more accurate and significantly (2000 times!) lower power then the DHT22. This will result in an increase in the emonTH battery life; from 10 months to several years. The Si7021 is also &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the DHT22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonth2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;emonTH V2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Si7021 sensor can be seen in the top right-hand corner of the PCB. The white film on top of the sensor is a dust film and should not be removed. The dust film is factory fitted and will protect the sensor from dust and air contaminants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Eben I’ve been working with OpenEnergyMonitor for the past 10 weeks as part of a summer placement organised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arloesigwyneddwledig.com/&quot;&gt;Arloesi Gwynedd Wledig&lt;/a&gt;; a local project aimed at highlighting the local tech sector employment opportunities on &lt;a href=&quot;http://parcmenai.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Parc Menai&lt;/a&gt; the business park where we are located in North Wales, and the difficulties that they face, as well as the great perks of living in such a beautiful area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/eben.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme organised placements for four students in four seperate tech companies in Parc Menai. Here is a video with highlights the whole 10 week scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2v2a3ZJq0E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working in a small company in a rural area, that has such a large online community has really opened my eyes to the possibilities that the internet and the digital age can offer, in that people are no longer bound to cities. Increasing infrastructure development in terms of roads and internet speeds has increased this mobility further, and I look forward to the growth that this will no doubt provide in Gwynedd. OpenEnergyMonitor is for me the perfect example of a growing business that has been made possible by opensource development, global connections and communities, and new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;me-and-gwynedd&quot;&gt;Me, and Gwynedd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynedd&quot;&gt;Gwynedd&lt;/a&gt; is area that we live in North Wales. I am currently studying physics at Cardiff University, and originally from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyffryn_Nantlle&quot;&gt;Dyffryn Nantlle&lt;/a&gt;. As you can probably tell by my failure to find a decent photo of myself doing anything else, I’m (like Glyn and Trystan)  a keen climber, and that’s been my primary reason for wanting to return to Gwynedd to work, with a long list of climbs in the Llanberis Pass, Ogwen Valley, and Tremadog, and more that I wanted to have a go at. It’s a great way to appreciate Gwynedd, in my opinion, and I even got to go climbing with Glyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the video here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzPMPY-I3_I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little cheesy, but we got to climb with RC drones filming, so that was pretty sweet :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other strong pull, for me, was the Welsh language; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language&quot;&gt;Cymraeg&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve spent two years now living and studying down in Cardiff, and the switch to the academic and leisure medium of English has been a little challenging, and it’s always amazing to come back to Gwynedd, and hear Welsh on the street and in the shops, as well as at home, and in the OpenEnergyMonitor workplace. A lot of our culture is tied intimately to the language, and it’s been good to feel that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ive-been-up-to&quot;&gt;What I’ve been up to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time at the company, I’ve learnt how to write basic software from scratch (I’ve only ever done experimental analysis using python previously) to Arduino boards and the ESP8266, my eyes have been opened to the possibilities of GitHub, and other resources. I’ve played around with adding a DHT22 sensor to the ESP8266 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP/pull/7&quot;&gt;creating an DHT22 &amp;gt; Emoncms example&lt;/a&gt; which I contributed to the emonESP GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also had the pleasure of working with Gwil on preparation and order fulfilment for the OpenEnergyMonitor shop, which has been fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting experience was the few times I visited the local electronics factory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dferrantigroup.com/pcb-population-test/&quot;&gt;Denis Ferranti&lt;/a&gt;  where the boards are all manufactured. It was really cool to see the manufacturing process, and the quality of the equipment there. It’s great to know that OpenEnergyMonitor are able to manufacuture locally, which contributes to the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-scheme&quot;&gt;The Scheme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the project that organised this placement opportunity, the four of us students (all at different companies) were asked to come to a conclusion on the situation regarding tech jobs in Gwynedd, and the so-called ‘brain drain’, as the best and brightest graduates leave the area to embrace city life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall conclusion was that perceptions need to change. People overwhelmingly do not view Gwynedd as a place with lots of potential for tech jobs, but research has shown that the truth is the very opposite, with Parc Menai alone set to be the location of around 200 new jobs in the next few years. At a presentation at Pontio, at Bangor university, the four of us students reccomended modernisation of the school syllabus, a closer relationship between companies and schools, more grassroots tech events (a brilliant example of this sort of thing are the events held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NorthWalesTechnology/?fref=ts&quot;&gt;North Wales Tech&lt;/a&gt; (check them out!), and better utilisation of social media by companies looking for skilled graduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Glyn, Trystan, and Gwil for making this summer such an incredibly fun and rewarding one, as well as an extremely eye opening one. I’m sure the company has a huge future, and I for one will be following future products and developments with keen interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day, and it’s a little sad. I’m writing this blog but should probably stop and help Gwil assemble some more emonTH’s.. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eben, out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also will soon be footage of the Dennis Ferranti factory we visited, I will post it here as soon as it arrives!

      &lt;td&gt;1201 times less energy per day!&lt;/td&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;energy consumed (joule, J) = potential difference (volt, V) × charge (coulomb, C)  
charge (coulomb, C) = current (ampere, A) × time (second, s) 
energy consumed (joule, J)  = potential difference (volt, V) × current (ampere, A) × time (second, s) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Assuming 1 sample per min and sleeping in between samples, 1440 min per day = 86400s per day. See HTU21D testing repo a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTH/blob/master/sensor_test/htu21d&quot;&gt;sub-repository of the emonTH&lt;/a&gt; for full calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An upgraded emonTH with a HTU21D sensor instead of DHT22 should benefit from substantially increased battery life, increased accuracy and lower cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve obtained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/12064&quot;&gt;HTU21D Sparkfun breakout to test&lt;/a&gt; and easily got it working with an Arduino using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_HTU21DF_Library&quot;&gt;Adafruit library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/htu21d_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some confusion with regard to the variants of this sensor &lt;em&gt;I believe&lt;/em&gt; from my research that the HTU21D &lt;strong&gt;replaces&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://octopart.com/sht21-sensirion-19013846&quot;&gt;SHT21&lt;/a&gt; made by Sensirion. Both sensors have identical pin-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to get a prototype emonTH with HTU21D up and running soon. I would be interested to hear if anyone has experience working with this sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For disucssion see &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/htu21d-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-possible-dht22-replacement/1106&quot;&gt;HTU21D forum thread.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Glyn Hudson</name></author><summary>I have been been evaluating the HTU21D temperature and humidity sensor made by Measurement Specialties as a possible DHT22 replacement for the emonTH. This is quite a new sensor, released in 2013. The Si72021 is also a posiblity with an identical pin-out and specs.

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/3: Continuous Deployment (OTA to ESP8266)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from my last couple of posts in this series we now have a working continuous cloud-based build &amp;amp; test (firmware compiling) flow using PlatformIO and TravisCI, to quickly recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code change is committed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP&quot;&gt;EmonESP repo on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TravisCI triggers a build (compile) using PlatformIO running in a TravisCI container in the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If build/compilation process fails we get an email alert, if pull-request we get a warning before merging if proposed changes break the build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a Git commit is tagged as a release the build process uploads the generated compiled binary (.bin) to the repo GitHub release page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to get the compiled binary from GitHub-releases (EmonESP in this example) deployed to a WiFi connected production ESP8266. Here’s the user facing EmonESP web-interface for this firmware update process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonesp-update.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OTA (over-the-air) firmware deployment process is based on Daniel Eichhorn’s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/squix78&quot;&gt;@squix78&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squix.org/2016/06/esp8266-continuous-delivery-pipeline-push-to-production.html&quot;&gt;excellent blog post&lt;/a&gt;. In summary the process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/esp-update-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
Diagram from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squix.org/2016/06/esp8266-continuous-delivery-pipeline-push-to-production.html&quot;&gt;Daniel Eichhorn’s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The build is tagged with a version number using PlatformIO build-flag, see EmonESP &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP/blob/master/platformio.ini&quot;&gt;platformio.ini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An intermediate PHP script connects to the GitHub API to check the latest release version and returns this as a string.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESP sends it’s current running firmware version to the PHP script using tag argument &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;tag=1.0.2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the running firmware version does not match the latest release version, the PHP script grabs the latest release .bin from github-releases API and serves it up as a download to the ESP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESP then flashes the compiled .bin OTA update using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries&quot;&gt;ESP8266httpUpdate library&lt;/a&gt; which is built-in to the espressif Arduino tool-chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intermediate-php-script&quot;&gt;Intermediate PHP script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally the production ESP8266 would be able to contact the GitHub-release API directly negating the need for the intermediate PHP script. However, there are a number of reasons why this is not practical at the moment. To quote Daniel’s blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ESPhttpUpdate currently cannot follow redirects. This is important since github hosts the release artefacts on Amazon AWS. But in the API JSON &amp;gt; object the address points to github, so the http client has to follow a redirect to download the artefact.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Github uses https for its API and will redirect you to it if you are trying plain HTTP. This means that you would have to know the SSL fingerprints &amp;gt; of the github API server and the AWS hosting instance since this is required by the ESPs secure client interface. After all the ESPs don’t have a chain &amp;gt; of trusted certificates stored somewhere. While the fingerprint of the github API might be stable, the redirection on Amazon AWS might not always use &amp;gt; the same certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is currently working example of this process (ESP8266 firmware + intermediate PHP script) in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ota&lt;/code&gt; branch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP&quot;&gt;EmonESP GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In it’s current implementation the update process described above is not secure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously secure delivery and verification of the update binary is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally the binary download to the ESP would be done over secure https. This maybe be possible, however https support on the ESP is currently not super stable and limited by the available memory (as mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A method to verify the compiled binary could be to sign the compiled binary with a private key which is verified by the ESP before firmware is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to hear from anyone with any thoughts / advice as to how secure ESP OTA firmware delivery can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
