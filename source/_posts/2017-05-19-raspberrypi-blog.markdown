I don't usually write a blog post about a blog post! However this particular blog post does merit a mention.

The lovely folks at the Raspberry Pi foundation have published a blog post about OpenEnergyMonitor:

#### [Raspberry Pi Blog: Open-source Energy Monitoring Using Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/open-source-energy-monitoring-raspberry-pi/)

The Raspberry Pi as been an integral part of the development of the OpenEnergyMonitor system. We make extensive use of the Raspberry Pi in our emonPi and emonBase units. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has always been a big insperation to use, therefore we are honoured to get a little mention on their blog.
