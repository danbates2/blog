I have just configured an emonGLCD and a battery-powered emonTx unit with 3 temperature sensors. This would make a useful heat-pump engineers tool, and probably has many other uses.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6CJx6SlT4KE/T5QwzWYc0PI/AAAAAAAAAB0/gUZAhU0WevE/s1600/GLCD+radio+thermometer.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6CJx6SlT4KE/T5QwzWYc0PI/AAAAAAAAAB0/gUZAhU0WevE/s320/GLCD+radio+thermometer.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>The emonTx has 2 probes (DS18B20's) on 2m cables, and one on-board the PCB. It's battery powered so can be put anywhere in range. The emonGLCD display shows the 3 emonTx temperatures and also a local temperature.&nbsp; Temperatures are transmitted via wireless from the emonTx to the emonGLCD every 2 seconds.<br /><br />Typical uses would be for balancing radiators. i.e T1 on the flow, T2 on the return. I have added T1 - T2 (delta T) because that is what you are often looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could also be used for air-in, air-off off an air source heat pump, or and flow/return situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would make a good tell-tale device. i.e. to alert if any system goes out of its best operating ranges.<br /><br />I also have the temperatures data going to a Nanode emonBase to be logged to emoncms so that graphs can display temperatures over time. You really need this to balance up central heating radiators. i.e. fix it to a different radiator every day and compare results. The flows can be balanced accordingly.<br /><br />The DS18B20's are not ideal because they are a bit chunky (as opposed to thermocouples). On the other hand, the accuracy is excellent and it seems that the values can be relied upon. I have chosen to pot-up the probes myself.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F4FmXiRSSEc/T5Q0s5e8FSI/AAAAAAAAACE/f2rJOeU2XnE/s1600/18B20+sensor+with+flex.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F4FmXiRSSEc/T5Q0s5e8FSI/AAAAAAAAACE/f2rJOeU2XnE/s320/18B20+sensor+with+flex.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>They are fragile, and the <a href="http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/waterproof-ds18b20-temperature-sensing-kit/">ready-made sensors</a> from the OpenEnergyMonitor shop are much more rugged and can easily be tie-wrapped to a copper pipe and insulated etc.<br /><br />Next thing is to battery-power the emonGLCD so it becomes a portable tool. &nbsp; <br /><br />Another addition would be a LCD pulse input. This would give me a reading of kWh, and would save me using a stop-watch, as I have many over the years. <br /><br />Adapting these devices could get addictive!!<br /><br /><i>By John Cantor <a href="http://heatpumps.co.uk/">heatpumps.co.uk</a></i><br /><br />
