Next weekend Trystan Lea and I (Glyn Hudson) will be down in London for <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk/2011/09/01/announcing-home-camp-4-hack-the-house/">Home Camp 4 'Hack the house</a>' event. We will be presenting our end-to-end open-source web-connected energy monitoring system. If you live within traveling distance of London please come along, we would love to meet anyone who is involved or interested in open-source&nbsp;energy monitoring.<br /><br />Home Camp is a series of un-conferences that brings together members of the technical community interested in using open systems to bring about a positive change in the way we use energy and appliances around the home.  With ever-increasing energy prices, the race is on to develop ways to utilise smart technology to help offset domestic energy consumption and lower carbon footprints.<br /><br />The event will be a combination of informal presentations on the&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;and more 'hands on' making, hacking and tinkering on the Sunday. Trystan and I will be around on both days will be more than happy to help anyone build their own open-source energy monitoring system and deploy a server installation of&nbsp;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emoncms">emoncms</a>. We will also have <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emontx">emonTx</a>, <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emonbase">emonBase</a> and <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emonGLCD">emonGLCD</a> kits for sale at special prices.<br /><br />When: 29th - 30th Oct<br /><br />Where: Central London in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk/">Center&nbsp;for&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;Collaboration&nbsp;</a><br /><br />Cost: The event is now free! Registration&nbsp;is required on <a href="http://homecamp4-eorgf.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a><br /><br />Who: See the event&nbsp;crowd&nbsp;sourcing page at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/homecamp4">Lanyrd&nbsp;</a><br /><br />We will also be attending the Open Source Hardware Camp on Thursday 27th Oct at the same location (C4CC). This looks like it will also be a good event:&nbsp;<a href="http://oshug.org/event/oshcamp">http://oshug.org/event/oshcamp</a><br /><br />See you there, Glyn.<br /><br /><br />
