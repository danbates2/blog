For a fresh clean start to 2018 the default Emoncms theme has now been set to "blue" :-)

The blue theme was choosen to give a consistant user experiance between the other OpenEnergyMonitor websites e.g. Forum, Guide, Learn, Homepage etc.

We like the clean look of the blue theme, we hope you do also :-)

If you don't it's easy to revert to back to the old black theme by setting `$theme = standard` in `settings.php`. There is also a user contrubuted yellow theme called `sun` which is available.

emonPi Emoncms will update automaitclly to use the new theme as long as settings.php has not been user modifyaed.
