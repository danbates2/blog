Now that both the <a href="http://www.wyfsd.org/cms/index.php?page=wind_turbine_workshop_2008&amp;lan=en">North Wales</a> and <a href="http://cardiffwind.blogspot.com/">Cardiff <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">EWB</span> wind turbines</a> have been built, it would be good to have some sort of laptop based graphical output of the power produced from the wind turbine when its taken up to a site for testing and so I have been looking at how to modify the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">OpenEnergyMonitor</span> design to do that.<br /><br />The wind turbine creates 12V DC electricity. It can produce up to around 500W of power, about 40Amps.<br /><br />I have decided to go along the invasive current sensing route with a sense resistor (also known as a shunt). When dealing with such high currents the sense resistor needs to be quite beefy! Here's a picture of my test setup using a computer power supply to simulate the wind turbine and a 50W halogen as a load. The large block in the middle is the <a href="http://uk.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?sku=1339340&amp;_requestid=124438">sense resistor</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Yqa3j9ZhET8/Sj-hhYQQF_I/AAAAAAAAAUw/4V1fki-YNMw/s1600-h/shunt.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Yqa3j9ZhET8/Sj-hhYQQF_I/AAAAAAAAAUw/4V1fki-YNMw/s320/shunt.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5350172477157808114" border="0" /></a>I'm now on the stage of getting parts for a circuit that will allow the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Arduino</span> to read the voltage across the sense resistor.<br /><br />I came across quite a lot of good circuit examples and advice on the linear technologies website <a href="http://www.linear.com/ad/current_sense.jsp">here</a>. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Im</span> thinking of following the battery current monitor circuit which can be found in their <a href="http://www.linear.com/ad/08-dc.pdf">DC <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">pdf</span></a>. Here's the schematic<span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Yqa3j9ZhET8/Sj-kUKRgE3I/AAAAAAAAAU4/xvJ4LYcy_LI/s1600-h/circuit.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Yqa3j9ZhET8/Sj-kUKRgE3I/AAAAAAAAAU4/xvJ4LYcy_LI/s320/circuit.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5350175548601537394" border="0" /></a>It can measure both current flowing in to the battery when the wind turbine is generating and current flowing out of the battery when there are loads connected.<br /><br />I will post up the results once its built, I also need to make a load that can vary between 0 and 500W so it can be tested properly, the current plan is to make that load from a mini 12V kettle and a mixture of 50W 20W and 10W halogen bulbs all of which can be turned on and off from the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Arduino</span>. Should be fun!<br /><br />If anyone has any experience with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">renewables</span> and DC current measuring circuits I would be glad of any suggestions on any of the above.
