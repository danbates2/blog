OpenEVSE (recently renamed to [OpenEV](https://www.openevse.com/)) design and build fully open-source EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equiptement) charge controllers for electric cars.

OpenEVSE charge controllers meet all the saftey requirements for charging EVs and are fully certified.

The interesting features of OpenEVSE charge controllers include:

- Variable rate of charge: e.g. charge current can be varied to match available power
- Integrated energy monitoring via a hosted incidence of Emoncms [data.openevse.com](http://data.openevse.com/emoncms)

I have recently started driving a Nissan LEAF EV myself, this seemed a perfect opportunity to build and test an OpenEVSE charge controller unit.
