Last night I attended<a href="http://oshug.org/event/26"> OSHUG event #26</a>&nbsp;in London and gave a short talk on Low Power Wireless sensors as well as the brief overview of the OpenMonitorProject and a quick look at what we've been working on recently.<br /><br />There are a couple of new screenshots in the presentation from the open-source <a href="http://emoncms.org/sap/introduction">SAP building&nbsp;modelling&nbsp;emoncms module</a> that Trystan is been working in with Manchester&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/CarbonCoop">@CarbonCoop</a>&nbsp;recently. This is an exciting bit of development. The idea is that the building model could be matched up to the monitoring results (temperature profile &amp; heat input) of a building, the model could then be used to investigate the effect of undertaking improvement measures such as wall, loft insulation or external&nbsp;cladding&nbsp;etc.. Finally after&nbsp;completion&nbsp;of improvement measures the monitoring data can again be used to evaluate the actual performance of the improvement measures.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="356" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21307459" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="427"> </iframe><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/OpenEnergyMonitor/osug-26-low-power-wireless-sensors" target="_blank" title="Osug #26 low power wireless sensors">Osug #26 low power wireless sensors</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/OpenEnergyMonitor" target="_blank">OpenEnergyMonitor</a></strong> <br /><br />It was great to meet everyone and put faces to (twitter) names!
