Over the last few days I've been looking again at the core data input, storage and access part of emoncms. There is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to improve performance and there are a lot of options so I thought I would start to do some more systematic benchmarking.<br /><br />So here are some initial benchmarks of feed data storage in&nbsp;different storage engines: mysql (myisam vs innodb), timestore and direct file access. I also thought Id have a go at&nbsp;writing&nbsp;the current implementation of input processing in both python and nodejs in addition to php to learn a bit more about these languages as they are being used and favoured by others in the community such as Jerome (python), Houseahedron (python) and&nbsp;Jean Claude Wippler of&nbsp;Jeelabs (nodejs). Id like to see if there is any measurable difference in performance between these different languages for the kind of application that we are developing and if there are any other benefits: easier to do certain things etc.<br /><br /><a href="http://jeelabs.org/tag/housemon/">Housemon</a> by Jean Claude Wippler is a good example of how a timeseries data storage and visualisation application can be implemented in a different way by using a mixture of direct file storage and a redis in-memory database with the server side part of the application written in nodejs.<br /><br />Intrigued by the idea of using direct file storage as&nbsp;Jean Claude Wippler does in Housemon&nbsp;and following the approach used by Mike Stirling in timestore of using a fixed time interval to simplify and speed up searching I had a go at&nbsp;writing&nbsp;a basic implementation using php file access and the results are good.<br /><br /><div><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a

necessary, instead we can store data in memory using an in-memory database like redis.

No benchmarks yet but interesting to look at the difference in how the code looks. I found each language pretty straightforward to use and online resources to get me passed the bits I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;know where readily available. The language links below show the core parts of the input processing stage of emoncms written in php, nodejs and python. I've also linked to emonweb a port of emoncms (or more a build in its own right be now) by Frank Oxener in ruby on rails.<br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/emoncms/experimental/tree/master/php">PHP</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/emoncms/experimental/tree/master/nodejs">nodejs</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/emoncms/experimental/tree/master/python">python</a></li><li>ruby&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dovadi/emonWeb">https://github.com/dovadi/emonWeb</a>&nbsp;(Frank Oxener)</li><li>go&nbsp;</li></ul><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://github.com/emoncms/experimental/blob/master/readme.md#servers"></a>Servers</span><br /><ul><li>Apache</li><li>nginx&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ismsolar.com/sistema-de-monitorizacion-de-alto-rendimiento">http://www.ismsolar.com/sistema-de-monitorizacion-de-alto-rendimiento</a></li></ul><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://github.com/emoncms/experimental/blob/master/readme.md#emoncmsorg-stats"></a>Emoncms.org stats</span><br /><ul><li><a href="http://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2013/05/emoncmsorg-load-stats.html">Emoncms.org load stats</a></li></ul><span style="font-size: x-large;">HouseMon</span><br /><br />HouseMon by Jean Claude Wippler stores data in 3 forms:&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>Raw log of the serial data received to file (compressed daily)&nbsp;</li><li>Redis in-memory storage for last 48 hours which makes for quick access of most recent data.&nbsp;</li><li>Archival storage via direct file access for data older than 48 hours, the archive is hourly aggregated data (hourly - unless a use case demands finer resolution at which point the archive can be rebuilt from the raw logs).&nbsp;</li></ul><a href="http://jeelabs.org/2013/02/17/data-data-data/">http://jeelabs.org/2013/02/17/data-data-data/ </a><br /><a href="http://jeelabs.org/2013/02/18/who-needs-a-database/">http://jeelabs.org/2013/02/18/who-needs-a-database/ </a><br /><br />Its quite clear from some of the above tests that the housemon implementation is going to be fast in terms of data access speeds (with redis storing everything in memory for the last 48 hours) and efficient in terms of data storage (binary files â€“ hourly data), the big difference is that full resolution data is not available after 48 hours but Jean Claude Wippler argues that it would be better to wait for a use case rather than implement higher resolution for higher resolution sake and that logs can be used to rebuild&nbsp;archives&nbsp;at higher resolution if needed anyway.</div><div><br /></div><span style="font-size: large;">Next steps</span><br /><br />If you have a standard emoncms raspberrypi install, changing the mysql storage engine to myisam should bring immediate performance improvements, especially if you have a lot of feeds being recorded, I will try and put together a script to make this easier and also update the ready to go image.<br /><br />The next development step I think is to integrate redis into emoncms by rebuilding the input processing implementation to use redis rather than go to disk to get the last feed and input values. Then&nbsp;it would be good to test both timestore and the integrated direct file storage in action on several parallel raspberrypi's, keep benchmarking the differences and then see where that gets us.
