Solar maximum value is auto-learning.&nbsp;</li><li>If no EmonTX or EmonBase info is received, amount of seconds when last package was seen is shown.&nbsp;</li><li>Assigned down button to switch on/off background light.&nbsp;</li></ul>Ideas: also add a animated wind energy icon, use an overall more graphical representation based upon a house with panel on the roof, wind mill in garden and connection to grid.  It's in a very early stage and I love to hear your feedback.<br /><br />Forked EmonGLCD sketch with changes can be found on <a href="https://github.com/drsdre/EmonGLCD">https://github.com/drsdre/EmonGLCD</a></div><br />From the forum thread here: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/888">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/888</a>
