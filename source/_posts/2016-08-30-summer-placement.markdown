Hello I'm Eben I've been working with the OpenEnergyMonitor as part of a summer placement organised by [Arloesi Gwynedd Wledig](http://www.arloesigwyneddwledig.com/); a local project to highlight the local tech sector employment opportunities on Parc Menai the business park where we are located in North Wales.
