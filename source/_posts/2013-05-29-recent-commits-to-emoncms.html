<br />There have been many great recent commits to emoncms thanks to PlaneteDomo, Baptiste Gaultier, Simon Stamm, Erik Karlsson (IntoMethod), Bryan Mayland (CapnBry), Ildefonso Martínez, Paul Reed and Jerome. Including improved translations, ability to translate javascript, query speed-ups, a working remember me implementation and work on the raspberry pi module.
