<div>Last year I met James Devine at <a href="http://homecamp.org.uk/">homecamp</a> a home hacking, automation and green technology unconference in London. He has been developing an arduino energy monitor based on an Analogue Devices ADE 7753 IC which is a custom energy meter IC for use with CT sensors. The ADE7753 looks like a really good way of doing the measurement, it communicates with the arduino via SPI and does all the energy metering calculations itself, therefore freeing up the arduino for other tasks. </div><div><div><br /></div><div>Here's a mockup picture from his site of the energy metering arduino shield that he is developing:</div><div><br /></div></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://arduinopower.pbworks.com/f/DSC_00746.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:left;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://arduinopower.pbworks.com/f/DSC_00746.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><div><div>His project aim is to create an accurate desktop scale power meter, suitable for measuring individual power usage at a desk, the power meter then communicates with a PC I think via the arduino bluetooth shield and it's all open source, have a look: <a href="http://arduinopower.pbworks.com/">http://arduinopower.pbworks.com/</a></div></div>
