A really cool talk by Dominic Muren of <a href="http://www.humblefacture.com/">Humblefactory</a> about manufacturing and design:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">"Modern manufacturing produces wondrous objects, in massive quantity, at a low price. But the costs to the environment, social stability, and economic justice are large, and often hidden. Small-scale, localized, clever manufacturing would minimize the ability for this cost hiding to continue. More importantly, local production gives the customer a bigger voice to dictate what they need and want out of products."</span></blockquote><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BhIl8lEuMjs" title="YouTube video player" width="480"></iframe><br /><br />Dominic has a lot of interesting articles and analysis on his website humblefacture, very much worth a read:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.humblefacture.com/2010/10/importance-of-human-scale.html">The importance of {human} scale</a><br /><a href="http://www.humblefacture.com/2010/09/djs-cloud-manufacturing-and-need-for.html">DJs, Cloud Manufacturing, and the Need for Modular Open Hardware</a><br /><div><a href="http://www.humblefacture.com/2010/08/ssg-framework-for-more-sustainable.html">SSG: A Framework For More Sustainable Electronics</a></div>
