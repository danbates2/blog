<br />In collaboration with <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/user/7232">Corina Sas</a> from Lancaster University we would like to to evaluate members' experience of building, setting up and using our monitors and how these impact on people's understanding of energy consumption and household practices. The larger aim is to  to explore how energy monitoring technologies could be better designed to support sustainable practices. <br /><br />A team of researchers for Lancaster will run this study consisting of interviews lasting around 1 hrs. For this, a researcher will visit you in your home at your convenience, or if you live further away from Lancaster/Manchester, then Skype interviews can be arranged. <b>As a thank you will be offer you an organic veg box.</b><br /><br />The plan is to c<b>omplete the study by end of the year</b>.  If you are interested and able to help, please contact the researcher with your available dates:  Dr Corina Sas at <a href="mailto:corina@comp.lancs.ac.uk">corina@comp.lancs.ac.uk </a><br /><br />Thanks a lot for your support. <div><br /></div><div>Please post any questions to forum thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/6156">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/6156</a></div>
