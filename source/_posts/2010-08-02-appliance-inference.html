A start on an investigation into the possibility of inferring what appliances are on and how much energy they use (especially their kwh per day usage)  from one measurement point at the supply to the house/building. If this can be done effectively it would be a much cheaper and less intrusive way to find out such information than placing a separate meter on each appliance.  <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/86">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/86</a>
