Been realising what a great source of information application notes are, when I started this project I didn't really know were to look to get good information on energy monitoring but I think I'm slowly getting better at it now :) I've put together a page here:<div><br /></div><div><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/51">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/51</a></div><div><br /></div><div>which is full of links to application notes. Thanks to Danny for the link to the AVR-465 note on creating an energy monitor with an atmel micro. Its even got open source firmware details there and an interesting use of opamps to increase accuracy at low current ranges which I'd like to try at some point.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you know of any other good resources, Id be interested in knowing about them, please post them below, thanks!</div>
