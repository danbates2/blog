<br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">As you know OpenEnergyMonitor is a collaborative project. The project would be nothing without the hard work, time and effort that so many of you dedicate.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">With the festive season upon us and the year coming to an end I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to everyone who's contributed in some way to the project over the past year.&nbsp;Contributions could be anything from a whole new module, fixing a bug, correcting a typo to helping out with discussions and support on the forums.&nbsp;We very much appreciate every contribution no matter how small.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br />Helping out with friendly support on the forums is an area where we are particularly grateful for assistance, as the project grows bigger (we're almost at 3000 registered users!) so does the user support requirements. It makes me very happy to see that the forums are a friendly place for new users to ask for help, as well as the first point of call for  discussing an idea.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Here are a few names of people that I've picked up as making a significant contribution to the project over the past year.
