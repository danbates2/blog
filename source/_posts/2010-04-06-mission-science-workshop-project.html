The idea is to use the arduino and computer based graphing/logging as a platform to make scientific measurements of things like: voltage, current, power, energy, temperature, light, etc, that can be used in workshops to make it possible to see useful, interesting phenomenon and demonstrate the use of computers in science. Mission Science Workshop teach science in a very hands on, experiential way, trying to keep kids curiosity alive and sparking their interest in science. Have a look at their website here:<div><div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.missionscienceworkshop.org/">http://www.missionscienceworkshop.org/</a></div><div><br /></div><div>I'm working with Mario Landau Holdsworth from mission science on the project, he teaches at Mission Science and has a keen interest in Arduino's, energy monitoring, electric cars, mycelia and teaching science in a fun way. He has been very kind to sort out the whole visit.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a part of the mission science project I gave a short workshop on the energy monitor last Friday. For the workshop I did a bit more work on the energy monitor design and tried to improve the documentation a bit, creating a printable energy monitor guide. I'm going to upload these to the main website today, but here are the printable pdf's for the mean time:</div></div></div><div><ul><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/HowToBuild.pdf">How to make a basic energy monitor</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/HowToBuild.pdf"></a><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/DetailedSystemDesign.pdf">Detailed System Design</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/Accuracy.pdf">Accuracy</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/ACPowerTheory1.pdf">AC Power Theory 1</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/ACPowerTheory2.pdf">AC Power Theory 2</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/HouseholdWiring.pdf">Household wiring</a></li></ul><div>I'm in the San Francisco area until the end of the month, working on the project and going hiking around marin county and hopefully Yosemite, if your in the area, Mario and I will be down at Mission Science building things so let us know if you'd like to come and have a look.</div></div>
