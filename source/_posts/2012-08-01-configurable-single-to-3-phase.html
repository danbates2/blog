<div>Some great work I'd like to flag up by <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/user/754">Pcunha</a>, who has developed a super configurable single to 3-phase interrupt based firmware for the EmonTX.<br /><br />Its up on github here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/pcunha-lab/emonTxFirmware/tree/master/emonTx_Interrupts">https://github.com/pcunha-lab/emonTxFirmware/tree/master/emonTx_Interrupts</a><br /><br />and there is more about it in the forum thread here:<br /><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/467#comment-5481">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/467#comment-5481</a>
