<div style="text-align: left;">Hello everyone,</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This is my first contribution to this blog after months of reading it :)</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I am Amin, I study a Bsc. of "<a href="http://www.tu-cottbus.de/fakultaet4/de/environment/">Environmental and Resource Management</a>" at the BTU, and I am currently doing an internship at the technical department at <a href="http://www.wagner-solar.com/wagnerEN/?ref=/wagnerDE/">Wagner und Co. Solartechnik</a> in Marburg.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">My main task in this internship is to dimension and design photovoltaic systems for our clients overseas, and I could not help but notice how pricy the existing monitoring solutions are: more than 400 euros for a box that monitors your inverter's production and makes the data available on the internet. So I started thinking about building a system that does that for a very "affordable" cost. And since I have caught the Arduino virus for quite some time (Wired magazine's fault), I started to think about making an Arduino-based photovoltaic plant monitor, this is how I found the open energy monitor initiative.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Months of browsing and thinking made this little idea grow in my head like a good cancer, and talking to people about it generated mostly positive feedback.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I am now determined to launch a commercial product (<a href="http://diydrones.com/">DIY-Drones</a> business model, more or less) that is based on the open energy monitor. This device, which I name for the moment Kirikou, will monitor the mains AC that comes from the meter to the distribution box in each building, plus 5 to 20 sub-circuit consumers. It will not require the intervention of an electrician (clip CT's). It will send the data to Pachube or Google Charts via Wifi. And it will cost 200-240 euros per unit.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Quite an ambitious target I know, but with the help and support of the inventors, the community and some other people, I am confident that I can make it take off. <a href="http://blog.ponoko.com/index.php?s=%22ten+rules+for+maker%22">Open source hardware businesses</a> started to pop up like mushrooms the last years, and that's fantastic! It is only fair to share the knowledge about things, it is a win-win situation for everyone and I really hope to see many businesses based on the open energy monitor.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">There are also some unconventional ways to get it started, like these sponsoring programs that help entrepreneurs get on their feet in the beginning. A very good friend sent me this link to the Zurich HUB fellowship, and I applied.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I thought it would be in the spirit of the competition to get a community involved, and I created this Ulule page (screenshot below) to raise 120 euros to build my electricity monitor based on the Blackwidow board.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ulule.com/kirikou-an-open-source-electricity-monitor/"><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs1168.snc4/151044_10150324187775461_904875460_15862761_726884_n.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I am really excited to start this adventure with the support of a community, I believe that we could develop and spread this together.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I believe the first step should be to get more organized and communicate more efficiently on the technical choices and so on.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Your feedback, comments, criticism is most welcome, you can also visit <a href="http://www.bouhablog.com/">my blog</a> if you want to know me better.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">By the way, the verdict from the Zurich HUB will be announced on Dec 20th (in a few hours), please wish me good luck :)</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Amin</div>
