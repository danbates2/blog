The emonTH V2 is an open-source, wireless, battery-powered temperature and humidity monitoring node.


The emonTH V2 features a Silicon Labs **[Si7021](https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents%2FTechnicalDocs%2FSi7021-A20.pdf)** temperature and humidity sensor instead of the [DHT22 sensor](http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor-am2302/). The Si7021 is more accurate and significantly (2000 times!) lower power then the DHT22. This will result in an increase in the emonTH battery life; from 10 months to several years (at least two years). The Si7021 is also *much* smaller than the DHT22.

*The Si7021 sensor can be seen in the top right-hand corner of the PCB. The white film on top of the sensor is a dust film and should not be removed. The dust film is factory fitted and will protect the sensor from dust and air contaminants.*

**[The emonTH V2 is now shipping via our online shop](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/emonth-temperature-humidity-node/)**

As with all our hardware units the emonTH V2 is [fully open-source](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonth2) and manufactured locally in North Wales, UK using non-conflict materials lead-free processes.
