The emonTH V2 is an update to the popular emonTH loe wireless temperature and humidity node.

The emonTH V2 replaces the DHT22 sensor with a **Si7021** temperature and humidty sensor. The Si7021 is more accurate and significnatly lower power then the DHT22. This will result in the emonTH battery life increasing from 10 months to several years! The Si7021 is also *much* smaller than the DHT22.

See DHT22 VS Si7021 comparison table
