All emonPi's / emonBase's shipped to date have included a Raspberry Pi 2. In the next week or so we will be upgrading to include a RaspberryPi 3. This is a nice upgrade: approximately double the processor speed and on-board WiFi with zero cost increase. 

Since the RaspberryPi 3 has got on-board WiFi a USB WiFi dongle is not required; even more costing cost saving for our customers, thanks to hard work of the Raspberry Pi foundation and a bit of [Moore;s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law).

If you receive an emonPi with a black acrylic fascia like in the photo above this means you have a RaspberryPi 3 inside. The reason for switching from punched-aluminium end-plates to black acrylic plastic is to allow the RaspberryPi 3's on-board Wifi to propagate out of the enclosure.

Note: The Raspberry Pi 3 also includes integrated on-board Bluetooth, however this has been disabled on the emonPi due to a serial port conflict. See our [original post on the Raspberry Pi 3](/2016/03/raspberry-pi-3/).

The Raspberry Pi 3 equipped emonPi's and emonBase's will be running the latest [emonSD pre-built SD card image](https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/technical/#software-overview) which includes the latest version of Emoncms as well as NodeRED and openHAB pre-installed.
