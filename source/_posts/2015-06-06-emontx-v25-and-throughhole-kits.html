We've had quite a few people ask about the throughhole emontx v2 and  emonGLCD's designs since we've moved away from stocking them in the shop  and developed the pre assembled units. I've also had several  conversations with people offline who said how much they enjoyed  building the kits and encouraged us to keep supporting and stocking  them. The challenge is the complexity of running an online shop with  many different product lines and the additional workload of kiting and  stock ordering - but it seems like it might be worthwhile for us to look  into a way to make it possible.<br /> <br />The emontx v2 currently uses different 3.5mm jacks to the emontx v3  and emontx shield, It also required a different case which needed  milling to use. To try and standardise on the components required I've  been working on a new version that is designed to fit in the emonTH case  that doesn't require milling and uses the higher quality 3.5mm jacks  used on the emontx v3 and emontx shield.<br /> <br />As I got stuck in to the design I thought Id add the powering via AC  circuitry that's on the emontx v3 and find a way of ensuring all spare  IO is available + the addition of a row of terminal blocks with power,  ADC's and digital IO breakout in much the same style the EmonTH.<br /> <br />The first revision of this new design is now available on github here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5" title="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5">https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5</a><br /> <br />and looks like this (im really quite pleased with how it turned out,  there's something quite satisfying about designing and routing together a  pcb, trying to find neat layouts and so on):<br /><br /> <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/board_0.png"><img alt="" src="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/board_0.png" style="height: 584px; width: 500px;" /></a><br /> <br />The main features are:<br /> <ul><li>2x CT sensor inputs using higher quality 3.5mm jacks used on the EmonTx v3 and emontx shield</li><li>1x ACAC Voltage sensing and power input</li><li>Terminal block power, ADC's and Digital IO breakout + full spare IO breakout.</li><li>Onboard DS18B20 footprint</li><li>Based around ATmega328 + RFM69 core</li><li>Fits in emonTH enclosure</li></ul>The main downside perhaps of this design is that in order to get it  into the emonTH case I needed to drop the number of CT inputs down from 3  to 2, the thinking being that most applications are house consumption +  solar pv. But Im aware that this does make is unsuitable for 3 phase  application, we do want to develop a dedicated 3 phase board design with  voltage sensing on each phase so perhaps that's the better option for 3  phase application than using the emontx.<br /> <br />I've sent off for a first prototype PCB from ragworm so will be  building and testing this design hopefully next week. Id welcome  thoughts on the design and any suggestions and may do another revision  before getting these made in quantity.<br /><br /> <strong>Common component kit</strong><br /><br /> The other idea we've had is that since the emonglcd and emontx kit  share so many of the same resistors and capacitors we could potentially  offer a general openenergymonitor throughhole component kit with enough  of the common components to build an emonglcd or several emontx kits.  Then alongside the common component kit would be the PCB and  emontx/emonglcd specific components such as the LCD, connectors and  perhaps the atmega. We're' just working out the pricing for this. This  could be quite a good option for people who have good home electronics  stocks of different resistors/capacitors and could simplify the kitting  for us with just one kit with 10x 20x of all the different resistors and  capacitors. Interested in hearing people's thoughts on the idea.<br /><br />This blog post is a repost from the forum thread here: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/10802 <br />
