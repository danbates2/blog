Smart watches seem to be all the rave at the moment. They could potentially be a convenient way to check your power and temperature feeds, be notified of events and control your heating.<br /><br />Our friend Ryan Brooks (<a href="http://twitter.com/spikeheap">@spikeheap</a>) has been working on getting <a href="http://emoncms.org/">Emoncms</a> feeds to display on his Pebble Smart watch as well as making the fist steps towards controlling his <a href="http://ryanbrooks.co.uk/posts/2013-12-08-pi-powered-central-heating-phase-1/">RaspberryPi controlled heating</a> from his wrist.<br /><br />Take it away Ryan&gt;<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z_qfPJ3LNwQ" width="420"></iframe> <br /><br /><br />Ryan's code it all on GitHub if anyone fancies joining the fun. It would be great to get an Emoncms app in the in new Pebble app store. Even if it is just a simple as being able to display a single Emoncms feed this would be pretty cool.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/spikeheap/pebble-emoncms">https://github.com/spikeheap/pebble-emoncms</a>
