<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I wrote a post on my personal blog about using content from open source projects in general and the Open Energy monitor in particular. Here is an extract of it:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There are now more than 960 registered members in the community, not all of them are active and quite a few contribute actively to the development of the project. But does that mean that the others are just passive members?&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem" style="color: #1b8be0; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.625; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Free rider wikipedia">free riders</a>? is that fair?<br />I started toying with the idea of using an arduino to monitor electricity consumption about two years ago, and I found out that someone else (Trystan and Glyn and quite a few others) already started developing that idea and sharing their work and findings online. Sharing their work and code online does not only&nbsp;<strong style="color: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.625;">save other people</strong>&nbsp;(actually humanity in general)&nbsp;<strong style="color: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.625;">a lot of time and effort</strong>, but it also allows for a much wider scope of fellow tinkerers to&nbsp;<strong style="color: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.625;">review and improve that work</strong>.</blockquote><div style="color: #333333; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">You can read the post <a href="http://www.blogbouha.com/2012/04/oshw-free-rider-dilemna/">on my blog</a>.</span></div></div>
