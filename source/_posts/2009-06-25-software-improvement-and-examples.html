I have made a start on rewriting parts of the software to make the code a bit more object orientated and easier to use. I was finding that every time I needed to adapt the software for a different use it was a bit messy.<br /><br />In the process of doing a the re-write I will be adding examples of each significant part of the whole program working independently.<br /><br />Have a look on the <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/3">software page</a> for part 01 - Reading data from the Arduino and conversion of the data to a useful form.
