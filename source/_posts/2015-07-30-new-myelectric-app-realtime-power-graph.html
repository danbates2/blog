Trying to support each one was leading to quite a lot of bugs in addition to more fundamental issues with time zones present with the power to Kwh/d daily feed approach. <br /><br />The "power to kWh" and "Wh accumulator" processors are both fully supported on the emonPi and emonBase running the low-write image. There's more on how this accumulating watt hour or kWh approach works here: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/3995">Development: Calculating Wh totals on the emontx</a><br /><br />I now have the new MyElectric app running alongside the MySolarPV app in my home and I'm really quite pleased with the results. The totals at the bottom and average kWh per day for each period gives me most of what data to see at a glance how my electricity consumption is fairing and having this information available on a wall mounted tablet really makes all the difference compared with having to login to emoncms on my computer to see the data.<br /><br />I would like to make it easier to switch in between the different apps, a side swipe would be really nice. I would also like to look into a way to make it possible to download apps from an app repository from within emoncms itself so that new apps could be added without them having to be in the app repository on github, there's quite a bit of work needed to get there thought.<br /><br />
