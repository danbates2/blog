Last night I attended [EcoHomeLab meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Eco-Home-Lab-Manchester/events/230714252/) in Manchester organised by the [CarbonCoop](http://carbon.coop/).

>EcoHomeLab monthly meetups at [MadLab](https://madlab.org.uk/) brings householders and green-technologists together to take control of home energy use and generation.

It was great fun to catch up with regular faces as well as meet many new interesting people.

I gave a short presentation overview of our efforts as OpenEnergyMonitor to make it as easy as possible for people to get started with energy monitoring and control (home automation) with a sustainability / energy saving focus.

I presented the recent work we have been doing to integrate platforms such as MQTT, Node-RED and openHAB ready-installed and pre-configured on the emonPi, our RaspberryPi based energy monitoring platform. These additional platforms run alongside Emoncms on the emonPi.

**See the [Integrations section of our user guide for more info](http://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/)**

Here are copy of my slides from the event:
