I attended the open source circular economy event OSCEdays in London. It was a fantastic event with a lot of energy and ideas exploring how  the circular economy could benefit from an open source approach.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_Gn7kS9kGMQ/VZl965UyCJI/AAAAAAAATak/UMpLQ-RQ6-E/s1600/oscedays.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="260" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_Gn7kS9kGMQ/VZl965UyCJI/AAAAAAAATak/UMpLQ-RQ6-E/s400/oscedays.jpeg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">OSCEdays at FabLab London</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iVHrLVdqWpY/VZl_FM3RFkI/AAAAAAAATas/FpO29-jdQSo/s1600/bda5d194978a0361.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iVHrLVdqWpY/VZl_FM3RFkI/AAAAAAAATas/FpO29-jdQSo/s400/bda5d194978a0361.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">Initial draft embodied energy analysis of the emonpi</a></td></tr></tbody></table>There was a wide range of challenges and projects there including: circular makerspaces submitted by <a href="http://www.greatrecovery.org.uk/">the great recovery</a> looking at how fablab's and makerspaces could encourage circular thinking, an initiative developing re-usable containers for cosmetics, a challenge looking at the implications of the circular economy for wearable technologies, 'trust is not waste' by <a href="http://www.therubbishdiet.org.uk/">the rubbish diet project</a> and ours looking at the embodied energy and lifecycle analysis of the OpenEnergyMonitor EmonPi.<br /><br />Id like to thank Rachel Stanley, David Green, WoonTan and Paidi Creed for all their help and input and for Erica Purvis and Sharon Prendeville for organising the event and the wider team that where involved in running the event in many other cities around the world.<br /><br />Our discussions and findings are partly documented here, there's also a bit more that needs writing up which will be online soon: <a href="http://community.oscedays.org/t/headline-challenge-open-energy-life-cycles/662/2">http://community.oscedays.org/t/headline-challenge-open-energy-life-cycles/662/2</a>.<br /><br />The research that I did on the embodied energy of the emonpi in the lead up to the event can be found here: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html</a><i> </i><br /><br />We are really interested in the lifecycle impacts and embodied energy side of OpenEnergyMonitor and so were going to keep building on this. I've almost finished a post that looks at the embodied energy calculation for the emonpi microcontroller and raspberrypi chips in more detail which will be up soon.<br /><br />If your interested in embodied energy, lifecycle impacts, the circular economy and how open source could play a part do check out OSCEdays <a href="https://oscedays.org/">https://oscedays.org</a>
