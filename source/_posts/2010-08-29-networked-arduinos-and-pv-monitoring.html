<div>Last weekend a group of us gathered in the mountains of north wales (were I live) for a build session: Ken Boak and Suneil Tagore made the long trek from London and Cardiff and Glyn Hudson came from just down the road.</div><div><div><br />We spent the weekend developing a networking system for Arduino's applying it to monitoring a PV system. Ken Boak has written two good blog posts detailing our work on his blog, have a look:<br /><br /><a href="http://sustburbia.blogspot.com/2010/08/wired-network-for-arduinos.html">Wired network for arduinos</a><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://sustburbia.blogspot.com/2010/08/snowdonia-weekend-hack-session.html">Snowdonia weekend hack session</a></div></div></div><br />The team from left to right: Suneil Tagore, Trystan Lea, Ken Boak and Glyn Hudson<br /><br /><img width="400px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yqpLbLUZR3Q/THuxD3SX-XI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/LZ-HH90ug7w/s1600/snowdon_group.jpg" />
