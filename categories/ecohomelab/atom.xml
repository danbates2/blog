    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I attended <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Eco-Home-Lab-Manchester/events/230714252/">EcoHomeLab meetup</a> in Manchester organised by the <a href="http://carbon.coop/">CarbonCoop</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EcoHomeLab monthly meetups at <a href="https://madlab.org.uk/">MadLab</a> brings householders and green-technologists together to take control of home energy use and generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was great fun to catup with regular faces as well as meeet many new interesting people.</p>

<p>I gave a short presentation overview of our efforts as OpenEnergyMonitor to make it as easy as possible for people to get started with energy monitoring and control (home auomation) with a sustainability / energy saving focus.</p>

<p>I presented the recent work we have been doing to integrate platforms such as MQTT, Node-RED and openHAB ready-installed and pre-configured on the emonPi, our RaspberryPi based energy monitoring platform. These additional platforms run alongside Emoncms on the emonPi.</p>

<p><strong>See the <a href="http://guide.openenergymonitor.org/integrations/">Integrations section of our user guide for more info</a></strong></p>

<p>Here are copy of my slides from the event:</p>
