    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the main problems with looking at demand at the single household level is that demand at this level is very spiky, there are often long periods of low use around 100W and then suddenly a kettle or electric car charger turns on and demand increases by 20-30x in an instant. Solar generation can be very spiky too and so there is room for matching but it can be difficult to get the timing right.</p>

<p>One solution to increasing supply &amp; demand matching at the household level is to have in home battery storage and diversion to hot water stores – but it may not be the best solution for all cases.</p>

<p>Aggregating supply and demand across households provides an example of how the degree of matching can be increased significantly by what could be described as sequential demand. Not everyone boils a kettle at the same time or a cloud passing over one households solar pv system may not be passing over another’s.</p>

<p>In order to explore the extent of increased matching possible through aggregation of supply and demand I have been working with Dominic McCann from Carbon Coop on what could be called a <a href="https://openenergymonitor.org/dev/smartgrid"><strong>‘virtual microgrid’ concept</strong></a>, we have a provisional front page for this here - please note that its still in early development:</p>

<p><img src="/images/smart-grid.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With only four households aggregating on-site solar, off-site wind, hydro and consumption and with total supply matching total demand over the whole period achieved by scaling the wind component, we can see matching increasing from 46% in the previous example to around 64% here. The resulting average carbon intensity is 132gCO2/kWh.</p>

<p>At this carbon intensity a heatpump (@ COP 3.0) has a delivered heat carbon intensity of 44gCO2/kWh, 81% less than gas and an EV (@ 3.7 miles/kWh) has a carbon intensity of 22gCO2/km 80% less than a very efficient petrol car doing 60 real world mpg, this compares with a carbon saving of roughly 45% vs direct gas heating and a petrol car if the electricity supply was from a grid supply consisting of gas, coal and nuclear at present UK proportions. Its a bit more complicated than this as more of the co2 was emitted when the EV was charging than at other times, the overall carbon intensity is just an average, Il come back to a more in-depth analysis of this again.</p>

<p>The result goes some way to illustrating why a mixture of renewable generation sources and aggregated demand ultimately increases the usefulness of the renewable supply and reflects the kind of results we see from running hourly zero carbon energy system models such as the one developed by the Center for Alternative Technology. These indicate that matching levels of between 62% and 78% are possible before storage and significant demand shifting with normal electric demand, heatpump heating demand and EV charging demand. See <a href="(https://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel/)">modelled supply/demand matching</a> based on ZeroCarbonBritain data:</p>

<p><a href="https://openenergymonitor.org/dev/smartgrid">Smart grid test intro page</a></p>

<p>Visible currently on the community smart grid test front page is the participating households renewable supply mix, real-time information on grid CO2 intensity and grid wind, solar and hydro. Household demand is not currently shown as there are not enough participants for the demand profile to be sufficiently anonymous.</p>

<p><img src="/images/supply.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>At the top of the page is a UK grid status indicator that is based on Dominic McCann’s work explained in more detail in <a href="http://carbon.coop/blog/zapaman/community-smart-grid-prosumer-perspective-part-2">Dominic’s blog post</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2016/04/ Understand-CO2-intensity-grid-electricity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zero carbon energy scenarios such as <a href="http://zerocarbonbritain.org/">ZeroCarbonBritain</a> feature significant electrification of energy demands previously provided by fossil fuels such as heating and transport. With electrification it becomes possible to supply these energy demands with renewably generated electricity from primarily wind, solar and backed up by storage technologies from short term stores such as batteries to long term stores such as power to gas.</p>

<p>We do not of course yet have a zero carbon grid. However there has been significant growth of renewable energy and a decline in coal generation in recent years.</p>

<p>The CO2 emissions of demand side solutions such as heat pumps and electric vehicles are significantly affected by the co2 intensity of the supply but in many cases installing and using these technologies make sense at the UK’s present supply mix and can make more or less sense depending on how you calculate co2 intensity and where you assume the additional electricity required comes from.</p>

<!--more-->

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>As an example the CO2 intensity of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) which provide the majority of electricity generated from gas in the UK have a co2 intensity of 360gCO2/kWh.

At this intensity a well installed heat pump that achieves an average COP of 3.0 delivers heat at a CO2 intensity of 129gCO2/kWh heat including 7% grid losses. This provides a significant 44% co2 emissions reduction compared to having an efficient gas boiler which delivers heat at a CO2 intensity of 230gCO2/kWh.

An electric car achieving a real world mountainous north Wales terrain driving efficiency of 3.7 miles per kWh (5.9km/kWh) including charging losses powered by gas electricity has a co2 intensity of 61gCO2/kWh which again provides a significant 44% co2 emissions reduction compared to real world efficient small petrol car co2 emissions of110 gCO2/km based on: 10.6 kgCO2 per gallon [1] and 60mpg (typical of the most efficient small car real world mpg [2].
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.carbonindependent.org/sources_car.html">[1]</a>
<a href="http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/real-world-mpg-efficient-small-cars/1214063">[2]</a></p>

<p>The average CO2 intensity for the UK grid as a whole in 2015 was <a href="http://www.earth.org.uk/note-on-UK-grid-CO2-intensity-variations.html">367gCO2/kWh</a> http://www.earth.org.uk/note-on-UK-grid-CO2-intensity-variations.html#fullyear2015 - providing similar CO2 emission reduction potential to the gas only calculations above.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that this average, results from coal generation with a CO2 intensity of 910gCO2/kWh being offset somewhat by generation from renewable energy and nuclear at 0gCO2/kWh resulting in a CO2 intensity that is close to what it would be if gas CCGT was our only supply source – which really highlights how carbon intensive coal is.</p>

<p>When we move energy demands from one form to another such as replacing a gas boiler with a heat pump the carbon reduction benefits depend heavily on what kind of generation provides for that additional demand. If the additional demand is provided for by CCGT gas turbines the switch makes sense, if it is provided by coal generation at 910gCO2/kWh it does not make so much sense. If it is provided by mix of renewable energy and CCGT is will make even more sense.</p>

<p>There are several different approaches to calculating the co2 intensity of delivered electricity each with their benefits and drawbacks which I will try and explore below and in further posts.</p>

<p>Whole grid averageHere we consider the grid as one big system with the CO2 intensity calculated as the total CO2 emitted by all forms of generation divided by the total demand over an extended period of time – one or more years. The co2 intensity of the UK electricity grid for 2015 was 367gCO2/kWh.</p>

<p>Near real-time co2 intensity using grid wide data</p>

<p>Here the CO2 intensity is calculated by the total CO2 emitted divided by total demand on typically a 10 minute basis. The CO2 intensity calculated this way will often show higher CO2 intensity in the day where gas and coal are a larger percentage of overall supply than at night time. CO2 intensity is also higher when its colder where demand is pushed up by higher heating requirements.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ukgrid.png" alt="UK Grid Carbon" /></p>

<p><a href="https://openenergymonitor.org/ukgrid">OpenEnergyMonitor UK Grid page</a> showing real-time CO2 Intensity.</p>

<p>If we use this real-time CO2 intensity in order to choose when to use electricity it gets more complicated, we may decide to shift electric vehicle charging or heat pump hot water heating to the night time in order to make use of grid carbon intensities that can often be 50-100gCO2/kWh less than day-time rates, but is this really a valid approach? The lower CO2 intensities at night are as a result of demand being lower and nuclear + renewables making up a larger share of generation, if night time demand is increased through demand shifting, turning on more gas and coal power plants, the carbon intensity would increase as well.</p>

<p>Given that most of the dis-patchable generation is gas and coal and assuming low levels of wind curtailment at night then it could be argued that the effective carbon intensity of moving demand to the night time should be calculated at the carbon intensity of this dis-patchable generation which depends on the proportion of gas to coal, a more in depth understanding as to how the proportion of gas and coal generation is decided would be needed to assess the carbon value of demand shifting. If the proportions are constant, shifting would make no difference, if gas is ramped up to meet the additional demand there may well be a benefit to shifting on the other hand if the difference is made up with more coal generation there would not be. There’s a bit more on this here using 2011 data from <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/en8sc/GridCarbonIntensity.pdf">Sam Cooper of Bath University</a> <a href="http://www.earth.org.uk/note-on-UK-grid-CO2-intensity-variations.html">linked from earth notes here</a>.</p>

<p>Shifting demand away from peak times may well make sense from a transmission and distribution grid capacity perspective but this is largely a different argument and would require a different calculation to assess. It may also be the case that some wind curtailment does take place although the precise extent of this and where on the grid using more will reduce curtailment is difficult to quantify.</p>

<p>In the next blog I will discuss the work I’ve been doing with Dominic McCann from the Carbon Coop on estimating CO2 intensity with onsite and green tariff renewable energy considered.</p>

However at this time of year the temperature in our bedroom is often only just about in double figures (old property with poor heating and frugal use) necessitating a seemingly moderate luxury of a hot water bottle to warm the bed up a little.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I assumed using the new electric blanket would result in an increase in our power consumption, however the energy monitor proved me wrong! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Having the electric blanket on for 30min used about 0.1KWh while boiling 1L of hot water to fill at hot water bottle used about 0.16KWh of energy, 60% more! Also the electric blanket does a much better job of warming the bed then the hot water bottle, after 30min it was almost uncomfortably hot even with an ambient temperature in the room of 11 degrees! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PRWQK4f8cpM/VIFxhBOblbI/AAAAAAABAjg/B0fmE75iFEs/s1600/blanket.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PRWQK4f8cpM/VIFxhBOblbI/AAAAAAABAjg/B0fmE75iFEs/s1600/blanket.png" height="456" width="640" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;200W Electric Blanket on for about 30 min&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9WhNqhDkTyk/VIWOeVUmd6I/AAAAAAABAro/XBAaAxspyKg/s1600/Screenshot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B11.38.19.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9WhNqhDkTyk/VIWOeVUmd6I/AAAAAAABAro/XBAaAxspyKg/s1600/Screenshot%2B2014-12-08%2Bat%2B11.38.19.png" height="286" width="640" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Kettle heating 1L of water to boiling&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;</p>

    <id>http://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2014/11/snowdonia-household-energy-study</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago Glyn and I and a friend of ours Bethan Gritten carried out an energy study with a local organisation called EcoBro of 17 households in Snowdonia, North Wales including our own.<br /><br />We looked at the energy used by each household for electric, heating and transport and what the effect would be of applying the solutions outlined in both <a href="http://zerocarbonbritain.org/">ZeroCarbonBritain</a> and <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">Sustainable energy without the hot air</a>, visualising the result using David MacKay’s energy stack graphics.<br /><br />I’ve been looking again at this work recently as I find it a really useful  and tangible way of looking at the energy problem and I’ve taken the opportunity to improve the energy stack graphic visualisation and put it up online here:<br /><br /><b>Dynamic visualisation: </b><br /><a href="http://egni.ecobro.org/data">http://egni.ecobro.org/data</a><br /><br />The code for it is open source and on github here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/TrystanLea/energystacks">https://github.com/TrystanLea/energystacks</a><br /><br />Here’s a brief run through of what you can see:<br /><br /><b>Current Energy Use</b><br />This first graphic shows each households current energy use and where that energy is used:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3My6GQ159Bo/VG5sgwDxuVI/AAAAAAAAMIw/q7vJ1EF6nvY/s1600/0present.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3My6GQ159Bo/VG5sgwDxuVI/AAAAAAAAMIw/q7vJ1EF6nvY/s1600/0present.png" height="282" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />24% of the energy used by the households come from renewable sources, whether biomass or 100% green electricity tariffs. The wide range of total energy use per household is quite interesting, using the dynamic tool you can explore the contribution of occupancy and floor area. You can also look at C02 and energy cost per household.<br /><br /><b>Solutions for reaching 100% sustainable energy for household electric, heating and transport.</b><br /><br />In both the ZeroCarbonBritain report and David MacKay’s Sustainable  Energy without the hot air, building retrofit (insulation and  air-tightness), heatpumps and electric vehicles form the cornerstone’s of  both significantly reducing the amount of energy we need to provide the  same amount of comfort/utility and making it possible to power the  remaining energy demand from electricity generated by sustainable energy.<br /><br />The following graphics show’s what the effect would be if each household in the study applied these measures:<br /><br /><b>1) All households switch current electric consumption to a 100% Green Electricity tariff:</b><br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HAjBniXZgCk/VG5sqcRnTTI/AAAAAAAAMI4/wUTAyUOrzEc/s1600/1greenelec.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HAjBniXZgCk/VG5sqcRnTTI/AAAAAAAAMI4/wUTAyUOrzEc/s1600/1greenelec.png" height="283" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><b>2) 100% green electric powered heatpumps, Biomass and electric cooking instead of oil, gas and coal. </b>For heatpumps it assumes replacing existing heat input with a heatpump with a COP of 3.0. See step 5 for a very basic application of building performance retrofit work.<br /><br />Heatpumps form the cornerstone of supplying the remaining heat demand  after retrofit in both Zero Carbon Britain and David MacKay’s  sustainable energy without the hot air. The performance of a heatpump is highly dependent of course on being designed, installed and controlled correctly.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cBsMQMzhm1M/VG5s1Wd8BqI/AAAAAAAAMJA/3BXvVWkJHUg/s1600/2heating.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cBsMQMzhm1M/VG5s1Wd8BqI/AAAAAAAAMJA/3BXvVWkJHUg/s1600/2heating.png" height="282" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><b>3) Switch all petrol and diesel cars to electric cars powered by renewable electricity </b>(Assuming mileage stays constant and an electric car performance of 4.0 Miles/kWh)<br /><br />The ZeroCarbonBritain report from CAT suggests a reduction in the number  of miles driven through a combination of increased use of pubic  transport, walking, biking and better planning of where we live in  relation to work/activities in addition to a switch to electric vehicles  which are both more efficient than petrol and diesel cars and can be  powered by renewable electricity.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lcZ0NG6-YWc/VG5tQICN2xI/AAAAAAAAMJI/LA2FrARb0CQ/s1600/3electriccars.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lcZ0NG6-YWc/VG5tQICN2xI/AAAAAAAAMJI/LA2FrARb0CQ/s1600/3electriccars.png" height="283" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><b>4) Electric trains instead of planes:</b><br /><br />In order to achieve the last 15% and still enjoy travelling long  distances we would need a switch from flights to electric train  journey’s, the model here just assumes that the number of flight miles  are replaced with electric train miles powered by renewable electricity and that the destination is reachable by train.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-69_K4jfM7Ik/VG5vP_2zs7I/AAAAAAAAMJc/-5hyXVWq_eM/s1600/4electrictrains.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-69_K4jfM7Ik/VG5vP_2zs7I/AAAAAAAAMJc/-5hyXVWq_eM/s1600/4electrictrains.png" height="282" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br /><b>5) At least 120 kWh/m2.year primary energy for space heating and home electric.</b><br /><br />Improving the thermal performance of buildings by adding insulation and  improving the air-tightness should be one of the first measures applied  and considered before or at the same time as any heating system changes as in step 2 above. The implementation of applying retrofit measures in the energy stack visualisation model here is only to set a maximum primary energy use requirement rather than to explore what’s possible on a house by house basis which would give a better picture of the potential savings from retrofit work.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KCL_Q5nWXLE/VG5tb3QwaTI/AAAAAAAAMJQ/kPdsojZwA0w/s1600/5buildingefficiency.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KCL_Q5nWXLE/VG5tb3QwaTI/AAAAAAAAMJQ/kPdsojZwA0w/s1600/5buildingefficiency.png" height="281" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br /><b>Powering Up with Renewable Energy</b><br /><br />The ZeroCarbonBritain report goes into a lot of detail on how the remaining energy demand after applying power down measures can be supplied by renewable energy and also the need for storage technologies to manage the intermittent nature of a fully renewable energy supply. We didnt look into this as part of our study but it would be interesting to explore it in more detail in the future to answer questions such as: what scale of community energy projects such as community wind, solar and hydro should we be thinking of if we are to supply our energy demands after applying power down measures? and how much should we be thinking about energy storage in a more local context?<br /><br />There’s a lot of things that could be improved about the study.  Rather than applying back of the envelope calculations on the effects  of applying the various solutions to each house it would be better to look at each house in detail, carrying out a full detailed Carbon Coop home energy assessment for each house on how energy demand can be reduced by up to 70% through retrofit work.<br /><br /><b>Related links</b><br /><br />OpenEnergyMonitor page on Sustainable Energy:<br /><a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy</a><br /><br />The ZeroCarbonBritain report:<br /><a href="http://zerocarbonbritain.org/">http://zerocarbonbritain.org/</a><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2648454/video/81962195">Alice Hooker-Stroud, Centre for Alternative Technology, ‘Zero Carbon Britain (Energy)’</a> <br /><br />Sustainable energy without the hot air <br /><a href="http://withouthotair.com/">http://withouthotair.com/</a><br /><br />Carbon Coop<br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2648454/video/81956917">Charlie Baker’s talk about carbon coop and 80% retrofit at the radical emissions reduction conference</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Where next?</b><br />I would be interested to hear any thoughts on how to develop this work further, where it should go next.
